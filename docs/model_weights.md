# Model Weights

You can download model weights by running the `download_weights.sh` script in the `form2fit` directory:

```
bash download_weights.sh
```

This will create a directory called `weights` in `form2fit/code/ml/models/` containing model weights for the matching module of `Form2Fit`. You should find one for each kit in the training partition of the benchmark.

We'll be releasing more matching network weights in the coming weeks, as well as weights for the place and suction networks.
